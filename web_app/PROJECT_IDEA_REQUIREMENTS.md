# ðŸ’Š Dr. Houseâ€™s Perfect Dosage Predictor - Project Requirements ðŸ’Š

## 1. Objective

Develop an educational tool to illustrate how neural networks operate by modeling the relationship between medication dosage and its effectiveness.

- **Start with a single variable (dosage level) and plan for future expansion to include multiple features.**
- **Provide practical insights in a beginner-friendly manner.**
- **Enable manual control over the training process to deepen user understanding of neural network learning.**

## 2. Scenario

**"Dr. Houseâ€™s Dosage Dilemma"**

Dr. House aims to optimize medication dosage to maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Model the relationship between dosage percentage and effectiveness score using a neural network.

## 3. Key Details

- **Input (x):** Dosage level, scaled between 0 and 1.
- **Output (y):** Effectiveness score, scaled between 0 and 1.

### Underlying Function:

\[
y = \frac{\sin(2\pi x) + 0.5 \cdot \sin(4\pi x) + 1 + \text{noise}}{3}
\]

#### Noise:

Add random noise to simulate real-world data variability.

### Simplified Function Explanation:

**Two Sine Waves:**

- \(\sin(2\pi x)\): Creates a wave with a period of 1 unit, introducing the first wiggle.
- \(0.5 \cdot \sin(4\pi x)\): Creates a wave with a period of 0.5 units, adding a secondary wiggle.

**Constant Term:**

- \(+1\): Shifts the entire function upwards for better normalization.

**Scaling:**

- The entire expression is divided by 3 to scale \(y\) between 0 and 1.

## 4. Project Tasks

### A. Data Generation

**Generate Data Points:**

- Use the simplified function with two sine components to create two wiggles across the dosage range of 0-1.
- Incorporate random noise to mimic real-world variability.

**Function with Noise:**

\[
y = \frac{\sin(2\pi x) + 0.5 \cdot \sin(4\pi x) + 1 + \text{noise}}{3}
\]

**Data Size:**

- Create 1000 data points for robust training and testing.

**Implementation Example in TypeScript:**

```typescript
function generateData(numPoints: number): { x: number; y: number }[] {
  const data = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
    const x = Math.random(); // Dosage from 0 to 1
    const noise = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.05; // Noise between -0.025 and 0.025
    const y = (Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * x) 
            + 0.5 * Math.sin(4 * Math.PI * x) 
            + 1 
            + noise) / 3;
    data.push({ x, y });
  }
  return data;
}

const dataset = generateData(1000);
```

    this.layers = layers;
    this.weights = [];
    this.biases = [];
    // Initialize weights and biases
    for (let i = 0; i < layers.length - 1; i++) {
      const weightLayer = [];
      const biasLayer = [];
      for (let j = 0; j < layers[i + 1]; j++) {
        weightLayer.push(Array(layers[i]).fill(0).map(() => Math.random() - 0.5));
        biasLayer.push(Math.random() - 0.5);
      }
      this.weights.push(weightLayer);
